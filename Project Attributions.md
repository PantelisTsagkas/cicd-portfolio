# Project Attributions

This project uses the following open-source libraries and resources:

## External Libraries

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Google Fonts (Inter)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) - Font family
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon library

## Code Structure

The HTML structure follows standard HTML5 boilerplate practices and conventional web development patterns.

## Note on Code Similarities

Some portions of this project may appear similar to other open-source projects due to:

1. The use of standard HTML5 document structure
2. Common CDN imports for popular libraries
3. Conventional meta tags and document setup
4. Standard practices in responsive web design

These similarities are coincidental and stem from following web development best practices rather than direct copying.
